This is a mobile app prototype built with Proto.io mobile app prototyping tool.

Goals:
To create a prototype of a food ordering app that choose food for its users via a survey. It is supposed to make the process of ordering food much more pleasant and fast. Additionally, it is also supposed to solve the problem of individual and group indecision when it comes to ordering food.

Set-Up:
Download the EasyEats-html folder. Run frame.html in Chrome.

How-to-Use:
The prototype will begin with a survey screen. The user will be able to answer questions by using an on-screen scroll-wheel. In order to get to the next question, the user must swipe left or right in the middle section of the screen, being careful not to touch the answer wheel (this is a limitation of proto.io). Upon reaching the next screen, the user may swipe up or down to scroll through different food options that were generated by the prototype. The rest of the app can be accessed through button presses where prompted.
